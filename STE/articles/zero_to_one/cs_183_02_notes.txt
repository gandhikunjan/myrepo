CS183 Stanford Startup Engineering - Class 2 - Party Like It's 1999?

To understand today's startup culture we must know the history of the 90's.

Nov 1989: Berlin Wall
1990-1991: Recession & slow recovery
1992-1994: Grunge & pessimism
1995: Netscape & the internet
1998-2000: Tech mania (nothing else was working, tech was a welcome change)

Sept 1998 - March 2000
Overly social
Irrationally Exuberant ("Stock always goes up." YHOO)
Excess of Money (led to sketchy people - "the aura test")

Dec 1998: Paypal
Hired friends, so didn't have to deal with influx of sketchy people
Voted worst business idea, still managed to raise Angel & VC rounds
Big challenge: get new customers, organic/viral growth (7-10% daily growth)

Feb 2000
WSJ covers exponential growth, valuation at $500M
Fortunate timing: everything crashed, now faced with building a real business


Hubris -> Schadenfreude -> Lessons Learned:
Late 90s was a bubble, shift was needed back to a real economy
Tech stocks > Old economy stocks
Tech > globalization
Future now considered completely unpredictable
Profit alone is all that matters
^^^ But this was all overly cynical. Driven by greed, hubris, envy, resentment


*Startup Lessons:
1. Believe and practice incrementalism
2. Startup must be lean: experiment and iterate
3. Zero advertising spend, create viral growth
4. Social -> Antisocial
5. Product is greater than "Biz Dev" (Steve Jobs was a product visionary)
6. Distrust rapid monetization. Rather, reinvest profits for growth
7. Don't discuss the future


Are We in a Tech Bubble?
This is the wrong question. Bubbles: 1. widespread intense belief. 2. Not true.
Anti-bubble (contrarianism) is also stupid though. The truth is not social. Thus going against the herd is just as stupid as going with it.


To understand startups, be TRULY contrarian:
*Think for Yourself*

What is valuable?
Is company X valuable?
Why?
How do we figure that out?
