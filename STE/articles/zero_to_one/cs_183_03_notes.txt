CS183 Stanford Startup Engineering - Class 3 - Value Systems

Recap:
1. What can I do? What do I think is valuable? What do I see others not doing? "What valuable company is nobody building?"
2. 1990s: Valuations were psychosocial. Avoid this herd-like confusion.
Class 3 Aim: Determine businesses' objective value. One way is financial/economic.


Great Companies:
1. Create Value
2. Durable & Lasting
3. Capture some of that created value


Valuation:
Multiples & Comparables
Pre-money Valuation (via Guy Kawasaki) = ($1M * n_engineers) - ($500l * n_MBAs)
Price-Earnings Ratio (PER): market value / earnings (ie, stock price / net income)
Price/Earnings to Growth Ratio (PEG): (market value / earnings) / annual earnings growth
PEG = *good indicator*
Analysis should factor in many points in time, not just the current moment (calculus).
Tech/high-growth firms require different thinking, not old economy mode
*10-15 year thinking* (Paypal, LinkedIn)


Durability:
Last Mover is better than First Mover advantage.
"You must study the endgame before everything else."


Capturing Value:
Supply & Demand Intersection: Perfect Competition vs. Monopoly (*Own the Market*)
Really valuable businesses are monopolies:
Last movers
Create Value
Sustainable
Decisive Advantages *critical* (Paypal had technological innovation and product innovation)

Monopolies are not necessarily bad. Competition can be overrated. Winning by a large margin is preferable to ruthless competition.

*Be motivated by having high ambition. Make the world a smaller place. Don't work in big markets. Find or make a small market. Excel and own it. Someone has to be the best. Bigger markets just make it harder to be number one (ie, valedictorian in a huge class or small class). The idea that a bigger market is better is _wrong_ (restaurants).

Small, successful networks
Driven by relationships
Personal
Idiosyncratic
